Since this is the first Github project for many of the new contributors, we will manage the files manually, until everyone is comfortable with Github.

Always come here when you need to identify the next file to work on. After you have identified the file, leave a comment here with the filename that you have chosen.

Below is the initial list of the files assigned to the first contributors:

Arianit - raw_files/copa_0.txt
Besfort - raw_files/copa_1.txt
Bleron - raw_files/copa_2.txt
Elira - raw_files/copa_3.txt
Kushtrim - raw_files/copa_4.txt
Lis - raw_files/copa_5.txt
Vullnet - raw_files/copa_6.txt

After you finish proof-reading the file, you save the file in the "clean_files" folder, along with your name, for example: "clean_files/copa_0_arianit.txt" . After the file's contents are uploaded to Mozilla Common Voice, then the file should be renamed to "clean_files/copa_0_arianit_uploaded.txt"

As always, any suggestions are welcome.
